# Web-Scraping-and-Natural-Language-Processing-for-textual-and-sentiment-analysis

# Project Description: 
It scrapes web content from given URLs, processes the text to clean and extract meaningful data, and performs text analysis tasks such as stopword removal, text statistics, and content transformation. The project involves cleaning the data and using different stopword lists to refine the text. The processed content is then analyzed for readability and other textual metrics.

# Python Frameworks and Libraries Used:
NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used here for handling numerical operations and arrays.

Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library, used for reading and processing CSV files, particularly to handle input URLs and stopword lists.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A key library for working with human language data. In this case, it is used for accessing predefined stopwords. Example module: stopwords for removing common English stopwords from the text.

Textstat: A library to calculate text statistics, used here for analyzing the readability and complexity of the text.

Requests: A popular library for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.

BeautifulSoup (bs4): A web scraping library that parses HTML and XML documents, allowing for easy extraction of data from web pages.

Re (Regular Expressions): A built-in Python library used for text processing, such as pattern matching and text substitution.

# Algorithms and Mechanisms:

1. Web Scraping Mechanism:
HTTP Requests: The project uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the URLs provided in the CSV file. For each URL, the script makes a GET request to retrieve the web pageâ€™s content (usually in HTML format).

HTML Parsing with BeautifulSoup: After the HTML content is fetched, it is parsed using BeautifulSoup, which transforms the raw HTML into a tree-like structure. This allows for easy navigation and extraction of specific elements (like paragraphs, headings, etc.) from the web page. The goal is to extract the meaningful textual content while ignoring irrelevant elements such as scripts, styles, or ads.
